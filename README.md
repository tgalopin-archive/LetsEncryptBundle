TgaLetsEncryptBundle
====================

TgaLetsEncryptBundle provides a simple yet fully configurable Symfony command to renew automatically
the HTTPS certificates of your website. It has never been so easy to use HTTPS in your Symfony application!

TgaLetsEncryptBundle is also able to warn you (by mail for instance) when the renewal of a certificate failed.
